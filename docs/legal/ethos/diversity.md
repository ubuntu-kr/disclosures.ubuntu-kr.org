# Diversity Policy

Ubuntu 프로젝트는 모든 사람의 참여를 환영하고 장려합니다. 우리는 모든 사람이 함께 하는 것을 기분 좋게 느낄 수 있는 공동체가 되기 위해 노력합니다. 모든 사람을 만족시킬 수는 없겠지만, 언제나 모두를 존중하고 잘 대하기 위해 최선을 다할 것입니다.

Standards for behaviour in the Ubuntu community are detailed in the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct) and [Leadership Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct#leadership). We expect participants in our community to meet these standards in all their interactions and to help others to do so as well.

Whenever any participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, subculture and technical ability.

Some of the ideas and wording for this statement were based on diversity statements from the [Python community](https://www.python.org/community/diversity/) and [Dreamwidth Studios](https://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/diversity) (CC-BY-SA 3.0).
