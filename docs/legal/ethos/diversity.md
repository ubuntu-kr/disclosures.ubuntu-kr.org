# Diversity Policy

The Ubuntu project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.

Standards for behaviour in the Ubuntu community are detailed in the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct) and [Leadership Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct#leadership). We expect participants in our community to meet these standards in all their interactions and to help others to do so as well.

Whenever any participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, subculture and technical ability.

Some of the ideas and wording for this statement were based on diversity statements from the [Python community](https://www.python.org/community/diversity/) and [Dreamwidth Studios](https://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/diversity) (CC-BY-SA 3.0).
